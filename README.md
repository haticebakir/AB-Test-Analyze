AB Testing with Python

A gaming company has long decided to make changes to the interface of a mobile game on the market. As a result of the change, the user wants to measure their experience. It analyzes the conversion rates of its new interface with A/B test.

One of their customers has decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if new interface converts more than existing.

In this A/B test, the client randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups, e.g. the test and the control group. It is the current interface control group in the analysis. The new interface that has been modified will be the test group.
